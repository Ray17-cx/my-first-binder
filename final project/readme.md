#Final Project — Coffee Quality Analysis

This repository contains the final project for BIOS 512.
The goal of this project is to analyze coffee quality evaluation data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), focusing on flavor attributes, processing methods, and country-level differences.
All analysis is performed in R using a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), as required by the course guidelines.
