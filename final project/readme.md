# Final Project — Coffee Quality Analysis

This repository contains the final project for **BIOS 512**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze coffee quality evaluation data from the **Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)**, focusing on flavor attributes, processing methods, and country-level differences.  
All analysis is performed in **R** using a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**, as required by the course guidelines.

## 1. Data Source

The raw data used in this project originates from the **Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)** Coffee Quality Database.  
I obtained the data from a publicly mirrored GitHub repository (no login required):

**GitHub Mirror of CQI Dataset:**  
🔗 https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database

The following raw files from that dataset are included in this repository:

- `arabica_ratings_raw.csv`  
- `robusta_ratings_raw.csv`

After additional preprocessing in the Notebook, I produced:

- `coffee_clean.csv` — cleaned dataset used for analysis

## 2. Project Objectives

This project applies the three analytical methods required by the BIOS 512 final project:

- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**
- **Clustering (K-means)**
- **Regression (Linear Regression)**

The analysis focuses on understanding what factors contribute to variation in coffee quality scores.

## 3. Research Questions

### **RQ1 — Clustering (B)**  
Can coffee samples be grouped into distinct flavor-based clusters using quantitative cupping attributes?

### **RQ2 — Processing Method Differences (C)**  
Do different processing methods (Washed, Natural, Honey) exhibit systematic differences in flavor attributes or total cup points?

### **RQ3 — Country Differences (D)**  
Are there meaningful differences in flavor attributes or overall quality across countries of origin?

## 4. How to Run the Notebook

This project uses:

- **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2, broom, cluster, factoextra, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebook with R kernel**
- **Binder/GitHub setup** as required by BIOS 512

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Open `final_project.ipynb` in Jupyter  
2. Run all cells
